function [ obj_file_image ] = find_OBJECT_FILE_IMAGE( lbl_info )
%  [ obj_file_image ] = find_OBJECT_FILE_IMAGE( lbl_info )
%    In the lbl_info, find OBJECT_FILE struct that contains field 
%    OBJECT_IMAGE
%     Inputs:
%       lbl_info: struct, LABEL of the crism image/table data
%     Outputs:
%       obj_file_image: 
%         struct, having field "OBJECT_IMAGE". Normally such a struct is 
%         stored in "lbl_info.OBJECT_FILE", which could be a cell array of 
%         such structs, or just a struct if only one "OBJECT_FILE" is 
%         defined. 
%         Normally, "lbl_info.OBJECT_FILE" is searched. A sub structure of
%         LABEL file can be also used as an input. In that case, if the
%         input has the field "OBJECT_IMAGE", then the original input is
%         returned. If nothing is found, then [] is returned.
%         Currently the first one of such structs is returned and this 
%         function does not support for lbl_info that contains multiple 
%         ones.
